    "2) Who are the key stakeholders?  (Even if it's for yourself, be clear about this).  \n",
    "3) Write down a short paragraph describing the solution, or better yet, sketch a simple diagram with the big pieces identified and a rough idea of how they connect.  This should easily fit onto one page (either a piece of paper or a single screen size).  \n",

    "5) Write down the key risks.  \n",

This means not using jargon (either technical or business) and keeping the ideas as high a level as needed.  For example, a simple box is completely adequate for representing a server (or a server farm)-no need to specify the actual processors or network details at this point."
